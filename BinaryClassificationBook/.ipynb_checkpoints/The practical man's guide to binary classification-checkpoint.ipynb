Logistic regression is one of the few algorithms which do, but most of the useful ones - random forests, gradient boosted trees, neural networks - do not. In this case, we are actually predicting a modified version of $p(x)$. To make the discussion simpler, we will call everything a score, and leave the discussion of actually estimating probabilities to the chapter on calibration.\n",
    "> Indeed, for many use cases (such as credit scoring, product recommendations, or fraud detection) actual probababilities are not that important; rather, their *ordering* is. So it wouldn't matter that my probability of defaulting on a payment is 15%; what matters is that it is 15% while my friend Bob's is 30%, hence mine is *lower* (by how much, we don't know). This is not the case for insurance, for example, where actual expected values need to be calculated. We will discuss this later.\n"

    ">It is natural to parameterize FPR and TPR via the threshold $\\lambda$ since $\\mathrm{TPR} = \\mathbb{P}(f(X)\\geq \\lambda | Y=1)$ and $\\mathrm{FPR} = \\mathbb{P}(f(X) \\geq \\lambda | Y=0)$. This motivates us to define the *independent* random variables $$Z_1 = (f(X)|Y=1),\\qquad Z_0 = (f(X)|Y=0),$$ for which $\\mathrm{TPR}(\\lambda) = \\mathbb{P}(Z_1 \\geq \\lambda)$ for instance.

Consider the situation below, where a new classifier $C$ (orange) lies in the region below the segment AB. $C$ is, *in any sense*, worse then the projection $C'$ (black) of C onto segment AB, since it has a higher TPR for the \"cost\" of the same FPR.

    "> Proof: let us translate our construction of the gain curve into the language of probability. The Y axis contains the proportion of points correctly classified as 1, i.e. $\\mathbb P(\\hat y = 1|y=1)$ which is just the false positive rate. We have seen in the Appendix for the ROC curve that, for a fixed threshold $\\lambda$, $$\\mathrm{TPR}(\\lambda) = 1 - F_1(\\lambda)$$ where $F_1(\\lambda) = \\mathbb P (f(X) \\leq \\lambda | Y=1)$ is the CDF for the score $f(X)|Y=1$. Hence, we let $y(\\lambda) = 1 - F_1(\\lambda)$ be our Y axis. For the X axis, it represents the proportion ($\\mathbb P$) of points with decreasing ($\\geq \\lambda$) score ($f(X)$). Hence, $x = \\mathbb P (f(X) \\geq \\lambda) = 1 - F(\\lambda)$ where the CDF $F(\\lambda)$ is that of the unconditional score: $$F(\\lambda) = \\mathbb P (f(X) < \\lambda),$$ which can also be written in terms of the conditionals $F_i$ via $$\\begin{align}F(\\lambda) &=  \\mathbb P (f(X) < \\lambda) = \\mathbb P (f(X) < \\lambda|Y=1) \\mathbb{P} (Y=1) + \\mathbb P (f(X) < \\lambda|Y=0) \\mathbb{P}(Y=0)\\\\\n",
    "&= \\pi_1 F_1(\\lambda) + \\pi_0 F_0 (\\lambda)\\end{align}.$$ Here $\\pi_1 + \\pi_0 = 1$ are the proportions of $Y=1$ and $Y=0$. We have thus written the gain curve as $$\\begin{cases}x(\\lambda) &=& 1 - F(\\lambda) = 1 - \\pi_1 F_1(\\lambda) - \\pi_0 F_0(\\lambda)\\\\\n",
    "y(\\lambda) &=& 1 - F_1(\\lambda)\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "To calculate $\\mathrm{AUG}$, ideally we would like to write $y$ as a function of $x$ and integrate. This is possible if we invert $\\lambda = \\lambda(x)$ and plug it into the expression for $y$. This is hard since $\\lambda$ appears both as the argument of $F_0$ and $F_1$. Instead, what we can do is to *write $x$ as a function of $y$ instead* and calculate the integral $\\int x dy$ instead of $\\int y dx$. These integrals are not the same, but they will be related as we show below. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We have $\\lambda = F_1^{-1}(1-y)$. Plugging this into the equation for $x$ yields (calling $G(x)$ the gain curve and $G^{-1}(y)$ its inverse:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "x \\equiv G^{-1}(y) &= 1 - \\pi_1 F_1 (F_1^{-1}(1-y)) - \\pi_0 F_0 (F_1^{-1}(1-y)) \\\\\n",
    "&= 1 - \\pi_1(1-y) - \\pi_0 F_0(F_1^{-1}(1-y)).\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "In the Appendix for the ROC curve we saw that we could write it as $y = R(x) = 1 - F_1(F_0^{-1}(1-x))$. This is almost what we have, but the roles of $F_1$ and $F_0$ are shifted. We can actually invert this expression to get $$x \\equiv R^{-1}(y) = 1 - F_0(F_1^{-1}(1-y)),$$ which matches nicely with the RHS above. Hence \n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "G^{-1}(y) &= 1 - \\pi_1 (1-y) - \\pi_0 (1 - R^{-1}(y))\\\\\n",
    "&=\\pi_1 y + \\pi_0 R^{-1}(y)\\\\\n",
    "\\Rightarrow \\int_0^1 G^{-1}(y)dy  &= \\frac{\\pi_1}{2} + \\pi_0 \\int_0^1R^{-1}(y)dy\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "Now, both the ROC and gain curve live inside the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$, which has area equal to 1, and have endpoints in $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$. For any such function,\n",
    "$$\\int_0^1 f(x) dx + \\int_0^1 f^{-1}(y) dy = 1.$$\n",

Now consider a false positive (=patient is not sick, but your test returns positive). Then they will need to go through an uncomfortable test, but they will not die. In this case, **false negatives are much worse than false positives**. Because of this, our focus is on high recall."
