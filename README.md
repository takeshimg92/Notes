# Personal notes by Alessandro Morita
Repository containing notes on several topics (under construction)

## Binary classification
These notes are meant for data scientists working on binary classification, especifically of imbalanced datasets. 
It contains:
* Explanations of metrics and models
* Worked examples
* **Mathematical proofs** (which might be hard to find even on standard references)
* Library with main functions built in the material

I hope these notes might helpt data scientists in their day-to-day applications.

> Binary classification is the simplest, yet most misunderstood problem in applied machine learning.
